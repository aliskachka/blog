Welcome to my blog! :) 
Cooking with Alli is a user-friendly website dedicated to cooks and food lovers. This website showcases my love for food and web development. Right now, itâ€™s more of a design project than a fully functional recipe site, but I hope you enjoy exploring it anyway!

Features:
Home Page: A welcoming interface with a dynamic introduction to the website.
About Us Page: Learn more about the mission and vision behind Cooking with Alli.
Blogs Page: A collection of recipes and culinary stories, displayed in an interactive and responsive grid layout.
Contact Us Page: A sleek contact form and essential details for getting in touch.
Recipe Cards: Each blog goes to the same recipe page. 

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For semantic structure and content.
CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For modern, utility-first styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Enhances interactivity if additional features are implemented.

The only issue I am currently facing involves the video files on my blog. When accessing the blog through the GitHub Pages URL, the videos take a while to start playing. I have already compressed the video files, ensured they are properly linked in the code, and tested them thoroughly. Notably, there are no issues when loading the blog through the live server on Visual Studio Code, where the videos play seamlessly. However, there is still a delay on GitHub. I am actively working on optimizing the video playback to resolve this.
