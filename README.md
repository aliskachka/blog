# blog
Welcome to my blog! :) 
Cooking with Alli is a user-friendly website dedicated to cooks and food lovers. This website showcases my love for food and web development. Right now, itâ€™s more of a design project than a fully functional recipe site, but I hope you enjoy exploring it anyway!

Features:
Home Page: A welcoming interface with a dynamic introduction to the website.
About Us Page: Learn more about the mission and vision behind Cooking with Alli.
Blogs Page: A collection of recipes and culinary stories, displayed in an interactive and responsive grid layout.
Contact Us Page: A sleek contact form and essential details for getting in touch.
Recipe Cards: Each blog goes to the same recipe page. 

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For semantic structure and content.
CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For modern, utility-first styling and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Enhances interactivity if additional features are implemented.

I hope you enjoy :)
